Thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my fifth and final internship task at Prodigy Infotech â€“ developing a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was an incredible learning experience and a great way to wrap up my internship journey. Grateful for the opportunity and excited to apply these skills to future projects!
